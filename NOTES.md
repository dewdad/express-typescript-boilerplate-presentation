## Why

Why did we start this Node.js Boilerplate.

- We developed a GraphQL Node.js Server - This was the initial Start
- But we want to do better
- So we analysed other JS frameworks - so many - no Typescript
- We also looked at other famous frameworks like laravel and spring
- Then we finally find some really awesome libraries in TypeScript for Node.js

Moreover, it is more error-prone

So how can we improve that

For example with annotations

Like you have seen them in spring

And what else
